The exponential growth of mobile phone represents interesting opportunities for the payment business and gives MobiCash

MobiCash turns any existing cell phone into a Merchant Point of Sale (PoS), giving the merchant the ability to do both 
Merchant-to-Customer and Customer-to Merchant transactions, opening up business opportunities for a multitude of small businesses
